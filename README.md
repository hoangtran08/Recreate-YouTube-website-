**Welcome to my YouTube Website Recreation project!**
This is a personal project where I've recreated the YouTube website using HTML and CSS languages in my spare time. 
This project is intended to practice and enhance my coding skills and is not intended to be used as a production website. 

## Disclaimer
This project is a non-commercial, personal endeavour created for educational and practice purposes. It is in no way associated with YouTube or its parent company, Google. 
This recreation is not intended to infringe upon any trademarks, copyrights, or intellectual property owned by YouTube or Google.

### Key Points:
- It serves as a coding exercise to improve HTML and CSS skills.
- This project is not an official YouTube website, and YouTube or Google does not endorse it.
- It is not for production use and should not be deployed as a live website.
